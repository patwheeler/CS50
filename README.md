# CS50 Introduction to Computer Science 2019
Harvard's online CS50 course

## Week 0
### Scratch
Created an animation using MIT's Scratch interface. Here's a link to the one I created https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/295931494/fullscreen/

## Week 1
Learned about the command line, conditional statements, data types, loops, and operators.
### Problem Set 1
##### [Hello.c](https://github.com/patwheeler/CS50/blob/master/Week1/Hello.c)
Practice using the compiler; working with stdio.h
##### [Credit.c](https://github.com/patwheeler/CS50/blob/master/Week1/Credit.c)
Using Luhn's Algorithm, determines the validity and type of credit card given a number. 
##### [Mario.c](https://github.com/patwheeler/CS50/blob/master/Week1/Mario.c)
Implemented the "more comfortable" version of Mario's pyramid of blocks. 
## Week 2
Introduction to algroithms
### Problem Set 2
##### [Caesar.c](https://github.com/patwheeler/CS50/blob/master/Week2/Caesar.c)
Encrypting messages using Caesar's algroithm
##### [Crack.c](https://github.com/patwheeler/CS50/blob/master/Week2/Crack.c)
A brute-force method for finding 5-letter passwords using DES-based crypt function. The time-complexity is O(N^5), so don't expect an answer any time soon.
